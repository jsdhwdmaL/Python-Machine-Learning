# Python-Machine-Learning
What I have done during the Big Data and Machine Learning summer program offered by Columbia University --
#### Try data analysis and model building (financial scenario)


## Since making the dataset used public involves the copyright problem, the codes shown cannot run properly. They are just for demonstration.
#### The jupyter notebook named "EDA" is not written by myself -- it is from one of my classmates. I'm putting it just to demonstrate the data analysis process.
