# Windows
## Step 1: Check/Install Python
### 1) See if your computer contains Python already:
i. Open "Command Window" by typing "cmd" in your computer's search bar, and then click "Enter" key:

ii. Type "python" (or "python3" in some cases):
- If the response includes the version of python, including other info (see the screenshot below) -- congratulations! Your computer has Python installed already! You can jump to **Step 2** to install PyCharm.

- If it does not (for example it says there's no such command called 'Python'), don't panic! Let's see the next step.

### 2) Install Python:
i. You can go to https://www.python.org/ to install Python. It normally costs no more than 10 minutes.

ii. Open the downloaded *.exe* file and complete set-up:
- You can choose either the default installation method or customized installation.
- If you choose the latter, you might need to first create an empty directory in the space you want to download Python into, preferrably setting its name to "Python." Remember to choose all on "Optional Features" page. When choosing "Advanced Options," choose the first five ones (the last two are really optional). Then select the directory you just created as your customized install location.

iii. Check if installation succeeded.
- Open "Command Window" again and type "python" in. It should appear as what **ii** describes.
- If so, congratulations! We've finished the first step and can continue to install PyCharm!

## Step 2: Install PyCharm
### 1) Download installation file from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
- There are two editions: "professional" and "community." Since the former needs subscription, usually the latter version is good enough for individual programmers.

### 2) Open the downloaded *.exe* file and complete set-up
- Like how we installed python, you can create a new empty directory in your preferred storage space (for example disk D) and customize the install destination folder.
- In the next page of installation, choose all five installation options. You can then set the "Menu Folder" as anything you want or as default. Finally, install it!

### 3) Set up PyCharm Environment
- Create new project
